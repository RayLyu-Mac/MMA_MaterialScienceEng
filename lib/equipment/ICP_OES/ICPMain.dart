          "ICP-OES (Inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry) is a technique in which the composition of elements in (mostly water-dissolved) samples can be determined using plasma and a spectrometer. The technique has been commercially available since 1974 and thanks to its reliability, multi-element options and high throughput, it has become a widely applied in both routine research as in more specific analysis purposes.",
