The knee joint is required to withstand large forces, ranging from 3x bodyweight during walking up to 7x bodyweight during movements such as knee extension and jumping. \nHowever the ACL is only able to withstand a certain amount of force before breaking. When loads are greater than the range, it may be plastically deformed or even tear. This is not uncommon in some sports player like soccer or tennis player.",

The test consists of bending a series of pre-cracked specimens to fracture. The specimen rests on two roller supports and is subject to a concentrated force P at its centre. The force is applied gradually until the crack growth becomes unstable. An extensometer is used to monitor the crack-mouth opening. The ratio Pmax/PQ should not exceed 1.1 for the test to be valid.  The basic background for this test is described above. Additional details appear in the ASTM E399-12e3 standard.\nAlso the measure the hardness of the sample on Rockwell C-scale and estimate the tensile strength by using Rockwell conversion chart.",
