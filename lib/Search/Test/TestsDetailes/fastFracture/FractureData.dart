However, during the production process defects are unavoidable, for example castings tend to contain pores as a result of gases entrained in the liquid metal during solidification. Welding often results in cracks as a result of the thermal stresses that develop during cooling. To understand the tolerable crack size can help engineer to improve the safety. ",

The test consists of bending a series of pre-cracked specimens to fracture. The specimen rests on two roller supports and is subject to a concentrated force P at its centre. The force is applied gradually until the crack growth becomes unstable. An extensometer is used to monitor the crack-mouth opening. The ratio Pmax/PQ should not exceed 1.1 for the test to be valid.  The basic background for this test is described above. Additional details appear in the ASTM E399-12e3 standard.\nAlso, the measure the hardness of the sample on Rockwell C-scale and estimate the tensile strength by using Rockwell conversion chart.",
